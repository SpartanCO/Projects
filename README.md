# Projects

These are some of the projects I have been working on.

The PumpItUp project is a DrivenData competition to predict the status (functional, need repair, and non functional) of waterpoints in Tanzania. I did some feature engineering and used a Random Forest classifier for my predictions in this project. There are a couple Tableau data visualizations displayed here too. I probably engineered the features a little too much. This is a project that I used in some job applications and I wanted to show what I could do with manipulating data and writing some functions.

The Flowline project is a very short data analysis project for my neighborhood Oil and Gas group. 

MSUvsUM was my first project. This was just a way of implementing many of the things I had been learning in MOOCs. It's a small dataset with few features, but whether or not Michigan State won the rivalry football game was fun question for me to ask. This project includes some web scraping from different datatables around the web, then I preprocessed the data, and finally used a couple different machine learning algorithms to predict if Michigan State won the rivalry football game.
