# Projects

These are some of the projects I have been working on. 

MSUvsUM was my first project. This was just a way of implementing many of the things I had been learning in MOOCs. It's a small dataset with few features, but whether or not Michigan State won the rivalry football game was fun question for me to ask. In MSUvsUM I pulled data from a couple different datatables around the web, then I preprocessed the data, and finally used a couple different machine learning algorithms to predict if Michigan State won the rivalry football game.
