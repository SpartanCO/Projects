## Learn to LDA with Iris Data
This was a blog post I wrote about using LDA as a preprocessing step for dimensionality reduction (check out https://www.jaclynkokx.com). I go through the math, theory, and code of implementing this the long way, and then I compared it to using scikit-learn's LDA method. I then presented this at a couple local Data Science Meetups.

## NLP_CHILDES1 
This is my first Natural Language Processing project. This project is still in it's beginning stages and is ongoing. I am pulling in speech from children of different ages and analyzing patterns. Eventually I would like to be able to predict speech delays based on age and patterns.This project uses BeautifulSoup and NLTK.

## PumpItUp1 
This project is a DrivenData competition to predict the status (functional, need repair, and non functional) of waterpoints in Tanzania. I did some feature engineering, Linear Discriminant Analysis to reduce dimensions, and finally used a Random Forest classifier for my predictions in this project. There are a couple Tableau data visualizations displayed here too. I probably engineered the features a little too much. This is a project that I used in some job applications and I wanted to show what I could do with manipulating data and writing some functions.

## MSUvsUM
This was my very first data science project. This was just a way of implementing many of the things I had been learning in MOOCs. It's a small dataset with few features, but whether or not Michigan State won the rivalry football game was fun question for me to ask. This project includes some web scraping from different datatables around the web, then I preprocessed the data, and finally used a couple different machine learning algorithms to predict if Michigan State won the rivalry football game.
